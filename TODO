=========Core functionality==========
x Flesh out lexer - actually spit out tokens that aren't just strings
x Refactor tokenizing special chars (implement/use a map? just an assoc list)
x Flesh out ast structure. Is a program just a list of function definitions?
    - Did this a bit. Need to clarify how I want to handle typing, variable declarations
- Figure out how to parse function definitions, particularly the parameters and how functions should
    be stored.
    x Implement expect function where I can expect a token and error out if it's bad
    - Add a comma token which I feel like is needed for parameter parsing
    - Ability to introspect on an AST. Print outs?
- UNIT TESTING!!! for containers (list, string) and tokenizing/parsing code.
    - I'd like to be able to spit out useful errors as well bc that would be easier to debug
    - I am very paranoid about seg faulting and I'm sure there are a ton of bugs here
- Read program from string into file


==========Nice to have==========
- Decent error messages
- Properly reclaim used memory
